        <h1> Predicting the Environmental Impact of Plastic Pollution </h1>
        <h3> Interdisciplinary Contest for Modeling - Outstanding Paper, Rachel Carson Award </h3>
        <h4> One of 18 winners out of 7000+ teams</h4>
        <p> Plastic pollution is a big problem facing the environment. In this paper, we explain how the seabird population can be used as a proxy for environmental health. Using our seabird population model, we predict if global plastic production continues at its current pace, seabirds will become endangered by the year 2056 and critically
        endangered by the year 2062. In order to save the environment from irreparable harm, policies must be introduced. We model the effects of various policies and find that an appropriate global policy is to reduce accumulated plastic by a constant amount each year until the remaining volume of plastic is less than 3,750 million metric tons. This policy will allow the seabird population to recover while imposing the minimum economic cost to society. We then develop an equitable approach for distributing the costs of this optimal policy across different countries. Responsibility for the seabird population is divided across countries by taking into account each countryâ€™s income, population, and accumulated plastic production.</p>
