        <h1> Measuring the Effect of News Coverage of Black Crime on Racial Bias in Traffic Stops </h1>
        <h3>ECON 1400 Economics of Mass Media Final Project </h3> 
        <ul>
          <li> Priming research suggests that people who are primed with negative stereotypical portrayals of black males are subsequently more likely to attribute responsibility of wrongdoing to black males. Does news coverage of crime involving black perpetrators have this sort of priming effect on police officers? I answer this question by analyzing racial bias in traffic stops, which are the most common interaction between civilians and law enforcement in the U.S.
          <li> To measure racial bias in traffic stops, I use data from 24 state and local police departments across the U.S. to compute the following two metrics (on a daily basis):
            <ol>
              <li> Relative stop rate: the rate at which black drivers are stopped minus the rate at which white drivers are stopped 
              <li> Relative hit rate: the probability that police officers conduct a search of an innocent black driver minus the probability that they conduct a search of an innocent white driver
            </ol>
          <li> I find that news coverage of black crime, regardless of the amount, does not have a statistically significant effect on relative stop rates or relative hit rates. With 95% confidence, I conclude that even if a black crime event receives high news coverage (more than 6 minutes and 40 seconds), it is still unlikely to increase relative stop rates by more than 0.000869 stops per 10,000 people or decrease relative hit rates by more than 7.232% in the week following the news coverage.
