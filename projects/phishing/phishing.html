        <h1> "Phishing in the Deep" </h1>
        <h3>CS147 Deep Learning Final Project </h3> 
        <p> Phishing is one of the most common cyber crimes. It relies on sending people deceptive emails and websites to trick users into submitting their personal information. This information can then be used by malicious actors to cause extensive harm to victims. Thus, being able to detect phishing websites is an important problem to solve. Our main research goal was to find an optimal deep learning approach to detect phishing URLs. 

        We created two deep learning models and compared our results. To create Model 1, we extracted eight features from each URL based off the features used by Chatterjee and Namin and then built a vanilla neural network, achieving an accuracy of 71.9%. Recent work by Hung Le et al. shows that learning a URL representation using deep learning improves model accuracy, so in Model 2, we automate feature extraction by running a convolutional neural network on the characters in each URL. With this approach, we achieve a much better accuracy of 96.2%
