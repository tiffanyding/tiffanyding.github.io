      <p class="caption"> The basic idea underlying our model is that people start off in state S, not trusting the tap water, but become trusting of the tap water over time due to government interventions and word-of-mouth between citizens. This spread of trust is represented as a transition at rate F to state I.  </p>

        <h1> Modeling Trust in Water </h1>
        <h3> 1st place, Brown Math Contest for Modeling </h1>
        <p> We create a model to predict how trust in tap water in Flint, MI progresses over time. Our model
          captures the idea that people can gain trust in something either through (1) their own experiences, or (2)
          word of mouth. By providing bottled water to citizens, the Flint government builds government trust, which
          gradually translates to trust in the government's statement that the tap water is safe. Once a citizen becomes
          trusting of the water, they have the potential to convince other citizens that the water is safe. We model
          this peer-to-peer dynamic using the SIR model for infectious diseases, because trust can be viewed as an
          infectious process. 
        </p>
        <p> Our model shows that the amount of bottled water distributed at any given time can signicantly impact how long the government will need to continue to distribute water. Another finding is that interaction
          between citizens has a huge effect on how long the government will need to continue to distribute water.</p>
