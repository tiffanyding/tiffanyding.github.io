      <h1>Hi there! I'm Tiffany.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a third-year PhD student in the UC Berkeley Statistics Department advised by
        <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/">Michael I. Jordan</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/index.html">Ryan Tibshirani</a>. My work is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am broadly interested in developing methods and theory to address problems that emerge when machine learning models are applied to the real world.
        I am particularly excited about <b>conformal prediction</b> methods for interpretable model uncertainty, methods that are designed to operate in settings with <b>distribution shift</b>, and reasoning about the effects of <b>strategic agents</b>.
        <!-- Some of the questions I work on are: Can we quantify the uncertainty of black-box machine learning models so that we don't have to blindly trust their output? How can we train a model when the underlying data distribution is changing over time? -->
      </p>
      <p>
       Previously, I received an ScB in Applied Mathematics and an ScM in Computer Science from Brown University, where I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/echen13" target="_blank">Elizabeth Chen</a>, <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/clawrenc" target="_blank">Chip Lawrence</a>, and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/" target="_blank">Stephen Bach</a>. I have also spent summers at Facebook and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
